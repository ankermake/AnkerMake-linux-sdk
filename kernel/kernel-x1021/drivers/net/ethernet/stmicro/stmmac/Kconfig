	---help---
	  This selects the platform specific bus support for
	  the stmmac device driver. This is the driver used
	  on many embedded STM platforms based on ARM and SuperH
	  processors.
	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

	---help---
	  The stmmac entry in /sys reports DMA TX/RX rings
	  or (if supported) the HW cap register.

config STMMAC_DA
	bool "STMMAC DMA arbitration scheme"
	default n
	---help---
	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
	  Ethernet device).
	  By default, the DMA arbitration scheme is based on Round-robin
	  (rx:tx priority is 1:1).
